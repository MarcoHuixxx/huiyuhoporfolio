    <h4 class="title">What are the symptoms of Parkinson's disease? How can symptoms be alleviated? </h4>
    <p class="subtitle">Parkinson’s disease
        disease (also known as Parkinson's disease) is a progressive damage to the nervous system that affects movement.
        Usually symptoms do not appear suddenly overnight, but slowly affect life. The symptoms may be different for
        each person. Another well-known chronic neurodegenerative disease is "Alzheimer's disease", but the symptoms of
        the two diseases are different at the beginning. Alzheimer's disease has more obvious cognitive deterioration at
        the beginning, while Parkinson's disease It is mainly characterized by uncoordinated body movements.

    <p class="subtitle">Shaking hands, shuffling steps, and muscle stiffness - common symptoms of Parkinson's disease
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">●The fingers, hands and arms tremble unconsciously when they are relaxed (rather than when
        exerting force), just like the thumb and index finger are rubbing back and forth when they are still. , shaking
        like a small piece of clay. When you start to exert effort to pick up a cup or mobile phone, the tremor will be
        less obvious.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">


        ●Move slowly, drag your feet when walking, and each step is small. Therefore, it becomes very time-consuming and
        laborious to complete a simple action, such as standing up from a chair or walking from the living room to the
        dining table. 
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">

        ●Muscles throughout the body may become stiff, tense, and lose elasticity. Such muscle stiffness will make the
        patient prone to pain and make it difficult to perform other movements. </p>

        <h4 class="title">In addition to the three main symptoms, patients with Parkinson's disease will gradually
            develop other psychological and physical symptoms. Physical symptoms include:

            Loss of spontaneous movements, such as rarely blinking, facial expressions becoming less and less, and arms
            not swinging naturally when walking.
            Balance becomes poor and falls easily.
            Abnormal nerve sensations, such as burning, coldness, or numbness.
            Speech is unclear, he hesitates before speaking, and his voice becomes monotonous.
            Writing also became difficult, and the writing became smaller and smaller.

        <h4 class="title">Innate genes or external influences? What are the causes of Parkinson's disease? </h4>
        <p class="subtitle">
            So why does Parkinson's disease exist? Let’s first understand a region called “substantia nigra”. The
            substantia nigra is located in the midbrain and contains dopamine neurons, which are responsible for
            producing dopamine to other areas of the brain. Dopamine is like a messenger between the brain's nervous
            systems and can coordinate the regulation of various motor messages. In patients with Parkinson's disease,
            the dopamine nerve cells in the substantia nigra of the brain are damaged or die, and their number is
            reduced. There is less dopamine that can coordinate movement messages, so movements slow down and become
            uncoordinated, resulting in movement disorders.

            The death of these neurons does not occur overnight, and patients do not begin to develop symptoms until
            nearly 80% of the neurons have been lost. Therefore, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease usually occur
            slowly and gradually. </p>
        <p>The key point that everyone will want to know is, what causes the death of dopamine neurons? There is no
            definite statement yet, but scientists believe that Parkinson's disease is affected by both the environment
            and genes. Therefore, a small number of patients have a genetic history of family gene mutations, and some
            patients are often exposed to chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides. . However, these claims have not
            yet gained widespread consensus.
        </p>
        <p>Most patients with Parkinson's disease develop after the age of 50, with the average age being 60. Those who
            develop the disease before the age of 40 are called early-onset Parkinson's disease, such as the woman
            played by Ann Hathaway in the movie "The Love Cure" It is a very rare case for the protagonist to be like
            that. In addition, men are slightly more likely to get the disease than women. Although Parkinson's disease
            does not directly kill people like cancer, if Parkinson's disease affects movement, various activities are
            restricted, the chance of pneumonia and other infections increases, and the patient is even simple in the
            late stages of the disease. It’s hard to live alone, and you usually need help from others to take care of
            your daily life.
