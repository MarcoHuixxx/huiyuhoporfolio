    <p class="subtitle">Stroke, commonly known as "burst blood vessel" or "cerebral embolism", is the fifth leading
        cause of life-threatening disease in the United States and the leading cause of physical disability. Stroke
        causes lifelong brain damage and has a profound impact on survivors' physical functions and psychology.

    <p class="subtitle">What is a stroke? </p>
    <p class="subtitle">
        Strokes are caused by rupture or blockage of blood vessels in the brain. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to
        the brain. If the blood flow to the brain is suddenly interrupted, brain cells will die within a few minutes.
        Post-stroke neurological dysfunction, such as speech, vision and movement disorders, etc. A severe stroke can
        lead to paralysis and coma, and may even be life-threatening. </p>

        <h4 class="title">Types of stroke

            Ischemic Stroke – This type of stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is suddenly blocked by a blood
            clot, preventing blood from being delivered to the brain. Blood clots often form due to a condition called
            arteriosclerosis. With this condition, the lumen of blood vessels narrows, forming fatty blood clots. More
            than 80 percent of strokes are of this type.



            Hemorrhagic stroke – usually more serious than ischemic stroke. The cause is sudden rupture and bleeding of
            cerebral blood vessels. This type of stroke is usually caused by high blood pressure or an aneurysm. An
            aneurysm is a balloon-like swollen sac formed in an artery, causing the blood vessel to weaken and expand,
            causing it to rupture.

            Risk factors for stroke
        </p>
        <p>Age – Two-thirds of stroke patients are over 65 years old.
            Gender – Women are more likely to have stroke than men.
            Race – Non-Caucasians are more likely to have strokes than Caucasians.
            Patients who have had a stroke or heart attack.
            smoker
            Patients with high blood pressure
            Obese people
            genetic factors
            diabetes
            high cholesterol
            Atrial Fibrillation A heart disease in which the heart beats too fast and irregularly. This disease
            increases the likelihood of blood clots forming in the heart.
            Carotid Artery Disease – narrowing of the main internal carotid artery, affecting blood flow and causing
            blood clots.

            Stroke prevention
        </p>
        <p>Control high blood pressure and keep it below 120/80.
            control diabetes
            Reduce "bad" cholesterol levels. For people who have had a heart attack or had a heart attack, consider
            taking cholesterol-lowering medications.
            quit smoking
            Don't abuse drugs
            Weight control
            Control stress
            exercise regularly
            Follow a low-fat, low-salt diet and eat more fruits and vegetables.
            Do not drink excessively, no more than two servings per day. (One serving is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer
            or 5 ounces of wine or 5 ounces of liquor)
            Take prescription medications to treat atrial fibrillation. Commonly prescribed medications are
            anticoagulants and blood-thinning medications.
            Consider the following surgeries:
            Carotid Endarterectomy – removal of plaque from the carotid arteries
            Angioplasty and Stent – ​​This type of surgery to widen narrowed carotid arteries may be beneficial to
            patients with severe blood vessel blockages</p>

            Tissue Plasminogen Activator for patients with ischemic stroke
            A blood clot-busting drug that significantly improves outcomes when used within three hours of a stroke.
            However, this treatment can only be provided in hospitals with neurosurgery facilities. For people who have
            had a hemorrhagic stroke, emergency brain surgery may sometimes stop the bleeding. Emergency treatment may
            include aspirin
